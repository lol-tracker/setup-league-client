# setup-league-client

My take on fixing the setup-league-client action on github.

Might not be the proper one but i didnt look too much into it.

Also its my first ever attempt on github actions so i hope i didnt mess up too much.

Includes [lcu-patcher](https://github.com/lol-tracker/lcu-patcher) which patches league binary to force old `enable_swagger` behaviour.
